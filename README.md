## Work/Project Examples

### Shuffl
WIP

I am currently working in a team of 6 to create a web application for streaming music simultaneously with others. It will include chat rooms to let users discuss the current song that is playing. Users will be able to vote on the next song from the queue. I am taking on the front-end side of the project along with 2 others which included prototyping, designing and building the user interface.

### SpringSprung

In a group of 5, we created a game for a client in an introductory iOS class. The objective of the game was to redirect a ball through a series of obstacles by using springs. I was in charge of the core mechanics of the game and designed the objects such as the springs, ball and obstacles. My tasks included designing the game to feel natural through the controls and user interaction.

I have been following these two youtubers who document their life as current/former software engineer students. Jarvis is a software engineer graduate who interned at google and worked at Patreon. When I first watched Jarvis' video, it was one of the few 'A day in the life' videos for software developers/programmers. These videos gave me a glimpse of the software engineering work culture and watching them made me excited to jump into the workforce.

Devon Crawford is a software engineer student who makes vlogs of his projects and life while studying. His most recent video is on his project

Lastly, while browsing reddit, I came across a post about a junior developer's side project in r/webdev. This project was a completely free music streaming web application that utilizes the YouTube and Last.fm API and was built without any JavaScript framework. Being able to create a web application that clean and functional inspired me to learn web development and later inspired the current project I am working on for my Web Systems class.
