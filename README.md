Application tasks for Critical mass

## Work/Project Examples

### Shuffl
WIP<br />
I am currently working in a team of 6 to create a web application for streaming music simultaneously with others. It will include chat rooms to let users discuss the current song that is playing. Users will be able to vote on the next song from the queue. I am taking on the front-end side of the project along with 2 others which included prototyping, designing and building the user interface. 

### SpringSprung

In a group of 5, we created a game for a client in an introductory iOS class. The objective of the game was to redirect a ball through a series of obstacles by using springs. I was in charge of the core mechanics of the game and designed the objects such as the springs, ball and obstacles. My tasks included designing the game to feel natural through the controls and user interaction.
